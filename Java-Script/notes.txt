Java Script :- 

* js is the most popular programming language used ro create interactive web pages.
* it was invented by Brendan eich in 1995 and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
* js is Scripting language.
* Stable verison of js is ES6(2015).

Characteristics of JS :-

1. client-side Scripting language:- The Code is readable, analyzable, and executable by the browser.
2. Interpreted language:- line by line execution.
3. Dynamically types language:- No need specify any datatypes.
4. weekly typed language:- semicolon is optional.
5. synchronous in nature:- it will executes line by line.

Difference between Java & JavaScript:-

Java:-
1.Java is a strongly typed language and variables must be declared first to use in the program. In Java, the type of a variable is checked at compile-time.
2.Java is an object-oriented programming language primarily used for developing complex enterprise applications.
3.Java applications can run in any virtual machine(JVM) or browser.
4.Java is a Standalone language.
5.Java is mainly used for backend.
6.Java uses more memory.
7.Java requires a Java Development Kit(JDK) to run the code.


JavaScript:-
1.JavaScript is a loosely typed language and has a more relaxed syntax and rules.
2.JavaScript is a scripting language used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages.
3.JavaScript code used to run only in the browser, but now it can run on the server via Node.js.
4.contained within a web page and integrates with its HTML content.
5.Javascript is used for the frontend and backend both.
6.Javascript uses less memory.
7.Javascript requires any text editor or browser console to run the code.



JavaScript Engine:- 
        The JavaScript engine is simply a computer program that interprets JavaScript code. The engine is responsible for executing the code. Every major browser has a JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code. 


How does JavaScript actually work?
        The program is executed from a binary format, which was generated from the original program source code. JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that.



Data Types in JavaScript:-
                It is used to store what kind of data should be store in a variable.

Two Types of Datatypes:-
1.primitive Datatype.
2.Non-primitive Datatype.

Primitive Datatype:-
        Which is used to store single value in a variable.
        EX- Number,null,boolean,string,undefined,bigint,symbol.

Non-primitive Datatype:-
        Which is used to store Multiple values.
        EX- Functions,Array,objects...etc
